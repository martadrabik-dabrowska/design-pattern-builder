# design-pattern-builder

The builder pattern is a design pattern that allows for the step-by-step creation of complex objects using the correct sequence of actions.
First of all you need to create a static nested class and then copy all the arguments from the outer class to the Builder class. We should follow the naming convention and if the class name is Aquarium then builder class should be named as AquariumBuilder.
The main advantages of Builder Pattern are as follows: It provides clear separation between the construction and representation of an object. It provides better control over construction process. It supports to change the internal representation of objects.
